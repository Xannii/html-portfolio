<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I'm Anna, a junior web developer. I started to get interested in web
  development not so long ago, but I'm really excited about it. I took a few
  courses on my own and made sure that this is the direction I want to develop
  further. I am still a student, but I am actively developing my knowledge and
  planning to find a job in this direction.
</p>

<p>
  I can say that I am quite persistent and hardworking. I love self-development
  and never rest on my laurels. Maybe I'm even more of a "workaholic", but it's
  my lifestyle, and I can't help but do something for a long time, I can't live
  quietly :D
</p>

<p>
  Along with studying web development, I am also improving my knowledge of
  languages, such as Czech and English. For me, learning something new is not
  only a challenge, but also a way to enjoy gaining knowledge. I don't think I
  would have made it this far without motivation and a sense of genuine
  enjoyment of the learning process. But I am also a human being and I like to
  relax as well. I especially like to travel and play sports. This is just a
  little bit of information about me, but I hope it gives you a little bit of
  insight into what kind of person I am.
